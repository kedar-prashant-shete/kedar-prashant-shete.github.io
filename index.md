## About Me
I am a mechanical engineer currently researching thermal energy storage systems. This allows me to work on the exciting confluence of the fields of fluid mechanics, heat transfer, turbulence, computational fluid dynamics(CFD), experiments in fluids and energy. I am now pursuing a PhD at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. My previous research includes Direct numerical simulations(DNS) of turbulent flows and heat transfer enhancement in fluidized beds and cyclone separators. I enjoy studying mathematics as a pleasant diversion. As part of the Industrial Assessment Center, I also visit industrial facilities in New England and reccomend energy efficiency measures. I have completed over 30 visits, and implemented reccomendations from my visits have saved customers over $1,150,852.00 annually.

## Work Experience

### Energy Engineer
As the lead Energy Engineer at the Industrial Assessment Center, I have conducted over 30 energy assessments and saved customers over $1,150,852.00 anually. A split up of implemented reccomendations from our center is shown, taken from [http://www.ceere.org/iac.html](http://www.ceere.org/iac.html).
