I am a mechanical engineer currently researching thermal energy storage systems. This allows me to work on the exciting confluence of the fields of fluid mechanics, heat transfer, turbulence, computational fluid dynamics(CFD), experiments in fluids and energy. I am now pursuing a PhD at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. My previous research includes Direct numerical simulations(DNS) of turbulent flows and heat transfer enhancement in fluidized beds and cyclone separators. I enjoy studying mathematics as a pleasant diversion. As part of the Industrial Assessment Center, I also visit industrial facilities in New England and recommend energy efficiency measures. I have completed over 30 visits, and implemented recommendations from my visits have saved customers over $1 million annually.

melting. </figcaption>

I study Latent Heat Thermal Energy Storage Systems(LHTES), with a focus on creating physics infused performance
correlations (inspired by flow physics rather than curve fit) for LHTES devices. I conduct combined numerical and experimental studies to support my
hypotheses. Our research will help reduce electric demand when used in conjunction with combined heat and power plants. It shall also be used to
integrate renewable energy sources like solar thermal with the grid. Our basic fluids research(conducted as part of this project) will improve our
understanding of turbulent natural convection.  For our project proposal entitled <strong><em>‚ÄúDesign of Latent Thermal Energy Storage Heat Exchangers for
Combined Heat and Power Plants‚Äù</em></strong>, me and my collaborators Prof. Dragoljub (Beka) Kosanovic and Prof. Steve de Bruyn Kops were awarded the
<strong><a href="https://iac.university/studentResearchAwards">Industrial Assessment Center (IAC) Award for Excellence in Applied Energy Engineering Research

At NREL, I worked on the characterization of thermal resistances of PCM based thermal energy storage (TES) and the effect of convection on heat transfer rates in LHTES. 
We published an article from my work there, <strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2022.105514">Measuring the Maximum Capacity and Thermal Resistances in Phase-Change Thermal Storage Devices</a></strong>. I also verified experimentally that latent heat transfer rate is constant for a significant period, and melted fraction varies linearly with time, as predicted in earlier <strong><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2021.102388">model</a></strong>.</p>

<figcaption> The image shows isosurfaces of a passive scalar twisted by the high Reynolds number turbulent flow. Isosurfaces of the scalar represent area available for mixing/reaction, increased areas result in enhanced mixing and reaction rates, making their study important. </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I studied turbulence and mixing using Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS). The mixing of scalars(such as temperature or chemicals) due to fluid turbulence is an important problem for modeling combustion, turbulent jets and geophysical flows. This fundamental research connects well to my LHTES research because heat transfer in LHTES devices is dominated by turbulent convection in the PCM. 
Our results from this research are published in the <strong><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics">Journal of Fluid Mechanics</a></strong> as <strong><em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2019.875">Area of scalar isosurfaces in homogeneous isotropic turbulence as a function of Reynolds and Schmidt numbers</a></em></strong> and as my Master of Science thesis entitled <a href="https://scholarworks.umass.edu/masters_theses_2/854">Calculation of Scalar Isosurface Area and Applications</a>.

<p>As senior engineer, I designed Air Cooled Condensers using the heat transfer software <a href="https://www.htri.net/">HTRI</a> and validate by design procedure against experimental data for 50 existing Air Cooled Condensers across the world(provided by Thermax SPX). Our project was focused on predicting heat transfer rates for tubes at various inclinations, fin pitch and length, which is a two phase turbulent heat transfer problem, making it tough to study numerically. We thus approached it using standard correlations available in literature and HTRI, and tuned our formulation to match experimental results provided by Thermax SPX.<br />

<figcaption>Simulation of flow in fluidized bed riser with mass inlet. The granular solid phase is tossed around by the fluid entering from the base of the riser. Additional granular material comes in through the inlet. In a Circulating Fluidized Bed(CFB) boiler, the granular phase would be coal or powdered biomass, and the returning mass inlet would be unburnt fuel separated from the exhaust by the cyclone separator(not in figure). This feature makes CFB boilers more efficient than their counterparts.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I increased the mixing and combustion efficiency in Circulating Fluidized Bed(CFB) risers using novel distributor plate designs. Circulating Fluidized Bed risers have applications in high efficiency boilers, gasifiers, combustors, dryers, power coating etc. When used as a boiler, they are accompanied by cyclone separators (to remove particulate matter prior to exhaust). Cyclone separators also have applications in the cement industry, waste water treatment, boilers technology and even vacuum cleaners. I also proposed alternative cyclone separator designs to enable heat extraction from cyclone separators, using internal fins. Our results were published as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1115/POWER2016-59165">Effect of Novel Swirling Perforated Distributor on Fluid Dynamic Characteristics of Circulating Fluidized Bed Riser</a> and two conference papers at <a href="./FMFP_Merged_Papers.pdf">5th International Conference on Fluid Mechanics and Fluid Power (FMFP 2014)</a>
